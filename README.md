Web-app notes
=============
* Buttons have verbs (save, delete, don't save, etc.) instead of 'ok' 'cancel', etc.
* Some iconography but not too much (only at certain level of menus/operations)
* For destructive operations prefer an undo link in preference to a confirmation window
* Few concepts (nouns, verbs, adjectives). Common ones are "free".
* Staggered loading. Ouside (layout) -> inside (data)
* Frameworks preserve back/bookmark, etc. features
* Hierarchy of page should be represntative of behaviour
* If there is a list on the page include placeholder text when the list is empty

* Solve a real problem/need
* Build a community, then make something valuable for them

## Annoyances
* Don't have thumbnails link to images if the images are the same size
* If an element responds to mouseover it must respond to click (links within spans but span is not clickable)
* Clickable elements which move (e.g. because some other content has loaded). Delay?
