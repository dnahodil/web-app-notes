Web-app notes
=============
* Buttons have verbs (save, delete, don't save, etc.) instead of 'ok' 'cancel', etc.
* Some iconography but not too much (only at certain level of menus/operations)
* Destructive operations have an undo link instead of a confirmation window
* Few concepts
* Staggered loading. Ouside (layout) -> inside (data)
* Frameworks preserve back/bookmark, etc. features
* Don't have thumbnails link to images if the images are the same size

* Solve a real problem/need
* Build a community, then make something valuable for them
